# My distortion box

## Idea

Make a standalone guitar plugin with somekind of distortion effect

## Features so far:

- Select proper audio devices for input and output :white_check_mark:
- Hear guitar played to input :white_check_mark:

## Known issues:

- Currently there is a bit too much delay when playing so some optimization is definitely needed
